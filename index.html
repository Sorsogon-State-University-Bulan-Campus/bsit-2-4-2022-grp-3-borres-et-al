					<h2> 📌 Frequently Ask Questions ❓</h2>
					
                    <p> 🎔 Question 1 : What is music ?
                        Music is the art of arranging sounds in time through the elements of melody, harmony, rhythm, and timbre. It is one of the universal cultural aspects of all human societies. Music is a pleasant sound which is a combination of melodies and harmony and which soothes you.                      
                        🎔 Question 2 : Who invented music ?
                        They usually put forward several answers, including crediting a character from the Book of Genesis named Jubal, who was said to have played the flute, or Amphion, a son of Zeus, who was given the lyre. One popular story from the Middle Ages credits the Greek philosopher Pythagoras as the inventor of music.
                        🎔 Question 3 : Why music is an art ?
                        Music is a protean art; it lends itself easily to alliances with words, as in song, and with physical movement, as in dance. Throughout history, music has been an important adjunct to ritual and drama and has been credited with the capacity to reflect and influence human emotion.
                        🎔 Question 4 : Where and when music began ?
                        Music first arose in the Paleolithic period, though it remains unclear as to whether this was the Middle (300,000 to 50,000 BP) or Upper Paleolithic (50,000 to 12,000 BP). The vast majority of Paleolithic instruments have been found in Europe and date to the Upper Paleolithic.
                        🎔 Question 5 : What is the importance of music ?
                        Music can raise someone's mood, get them excited, or make them calm and relaxed. Music also - and this is important - allows us to feel nearly or possibly all emotions that we experience in our lives. It can lessen the stress, pain, struggle, distraction and bring positivity and calmness in our daily life.
                        🎔 Question 6 : What are the genre of music ?
